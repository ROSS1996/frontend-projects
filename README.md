### What I learned

I learned how to setup a filter system by passing 'filters' state and setter function through each components. Those filters serve as conditionals to render each object in the JSON.

I also learned how to create static github pages with Vite without the need of creating a new repo by adding "**base: './'**" in the vite.config.js file.

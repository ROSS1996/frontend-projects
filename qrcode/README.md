## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

I improved my knowledge regarding the usage of flex boxes, in which i used it  to center the items in the middle of the page.

```css
  main {
    height: 97vh;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
  }
```

### Continued development

I will work on refining my usage of media queries in order to improve responsiveness, as well as start developing pages in a mobile-first workflow.
